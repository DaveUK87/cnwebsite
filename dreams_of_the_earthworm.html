            Wings spread, the white gull soars through a blanket of cerulean blue, carried on currents of wind that whip and thrash about as though angry at their own aimlessness.<br>
            But the gull is a master of the skies, effortlessly she glides ever onwards over thick green canopies and rolling, crashing waves of deep, dark navy.<br>
            Where she travels, can only be guessed at, why she flies can only be admired, a statement of nature - "look upon my work and be awed."<br>
            <br>
            The lowly earthworm does not look, he is unconcerned with such grand, sweeping notions.<br>
            To him, he lives in a dank, cold and dark world.<br>
            His only concerns are feeding, mating and living another day.<br>
            At any moment, the gull could swoop from her kingdom in the clouds and end the earthworm's existence.<br>
            Such is life, such is nature.<br>
            We live, we try to be as free as a white gull, but how many of us are earthworms?<br>
            Just getting by, to live another day.<br>
            <br>
            At night, I soar and screech in exultation, the whole world my playground.<br>
            Then I wake and in the cold light of the morning, I am the earthworm.<br>
