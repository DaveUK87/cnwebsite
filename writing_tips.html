            <li>I think the most important thing to remember when writing is that there is no right or wrong way to express yourself.</li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect! Nobody is born a great writer, it takes time and dedication to achieve anything in life and creative writing is no different.</li>
            <li>Poetry does not have to rhyme. Mine doesn't! But if that's your thing, go for it!</li>
            <li>One way to improve your writing is to practice a 'stream of conciousness.' Close your eyes, put pen to paper (maybe play a little music to set the mood) and let your imagination do the work. You may be surprised!</li>
            <li>Don't beat yourself up! Avoid comparing your work against others work. Everyone is on their own journey and as long as you're moving forward, the pace is irrelevant.</li>
            <li>When creating characters, flesh them out as much as possible. Make notes, invent a backstory, give them goals and aspirations, likes and dislikes. The more detail, the more believable the character.</li>
            <li>Struggling to think of a descriptive term? Google it. For example, "he was bad." Not great, huh? How about... "he emitted despair in his wake." Play around, have fun with it!</li>
