        <p class="poem">
            As darkness falls, I come alive. My time... has come.<br>
            I make my way into the night, feeling my senses awaken one by one.<br>
            The shadows are my friend as I slink along dimly lit streets and through dense vegetation.<br>
            My ears prick up at every noise, every flash of movement is caught by my keen eyes.<br>
            I am a hunter on the prowl, dealing swift death in an instant with tooth and claw.<br>
            I savor the hot blood of my latest kill as it drips down my chin.<br>
            Sinuously, I ascend to the roof tops and gaze at my realm from on high, alit by a thousand sparkling diamonds in the sky above.<br>
            Suddenly, I spot movement and in a flash, I leap from the roof to pursue this trespasser, this invader of my domain.<br>
            In a moment, I am upon him... teeth, claw, blood and sinew.<br>
            He flees, limping and whimpering in pain because nothing can stand against me.<br>
            As dawn's first rays creep over the horizon, I return to my home to rest.<br>
            Swaying with the drunken pride of a night asserting my dominance.<br>
            I climb the stairs, leap onto my bed... just as my servant awakes to wait upon my every need.<br>
            <br>
            "Good morning Mr. Truffles! Who's a good boy?!"
