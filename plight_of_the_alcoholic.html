            Infinite, endless, black.<br>
            The kind of darkness that would be described as having weight, if weight could be felt in this void.<br>
            There is no heat, no warmth, no cold, no smells, no sound.<br>
            <br>
            Do I even exist?<br>
            <br>
            Am I just a mote, floating in nothing?<br>
            But what are these thoughts I'm having?<br>
            There must be something because otherwise, there would be no voice in my head, no words to describe this emptiness.<br>
            Feeling nothing is... comfortable.<br>
            Hold onto the feeling that may or may not exist.<br>
            When light returns, it will bring pain.<br>
            Awareness of self.<br>
            I am nothing, inside of nothing, in this space that may not exist.<br>
            And that's just how I like it.<br>
            <br>
            Without warning, without pretense, pain blossoms inside of my head.<br>
            Wait, my head?<br>
            I can feel again... my eyes are closed.<br>
            No!<br>
            I don't want this burden of conciousness... let me return to nothing.<br>
            But alas, the void has slipped away, I am here, I am alive.<br>
            <br>
            And my head feels like the aftermath of a pitched battle between elephants.<br>
            <br>
            I can sense that there is light, if only I could open my eyes to see it.<br>
            I am lying on a mattress in a space within a building, but where am I?<br>
            Am I alone?<br>
            Why is my throat so dry?<br>
            I try to swallow, but I might as well be attempting to gulp down a mug of flour.<br>
            I realise... that my head is in the middle of something foul-smelling, wet and sticky.<br>
            <br>
            Oh, please let me return to infinite, unfeeling dark!<br>
            <br>
            Reality, I reject you and this shame!<br>
            <br>
            With difficulty, I open my eyes... and raise my head.<br>
            On the floor, multiple empty bottles... the air is thick with the cloying scent of alcohol mixed with vomit.<br>
            The room rolls and spins, unfamiliar to me through the haze.<br>
            But the more pressing matter remains, who even am I?<br>
            <br>
            Must of been quite the night.<br>
            Guess I'll never drink again.<br>
            The lies we tell ourselves.<br>
