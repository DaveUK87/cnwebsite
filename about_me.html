        I have always had a great passion for writing. One day I would love it if I could achieve my dream of being a published author.<br>
        <br>
        I am 33 years old, I live with my elderly father and my pets.<br>
        <br>
        When I'm not writing, I enjoy walking my dog, playing video games and developing my growing passion for all things tech.<br>
        <br>
        I am in the latter stages of the develop coding course by Code Nation, which I have thouroughly enjoyed!<br>
